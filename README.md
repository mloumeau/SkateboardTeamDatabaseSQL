# SkateboardTeamDatabaseSQL

# Overview

The python file generates the skateboard.db file. It initiates the .db file with all the proper information inside all of the tables. Not only does the python file
generate the .db file, but it also provides prompts for data manipulation for the user to interact with. The .db file contains all the relevant information, and
the python file is able to manipulate it.


I wrote this program because I thought it would be fun to have more in-depth statistics with skateboarding. I've been a big fan of skateboarding for over 15 years,
and I have yet to see a database that shows statistics for various topics. This seemed to be a relevant program that has yet to be publicly output.

# Relational Database

The data I am working with for this SQL database is simple. The tables represent all of the professional skateboard teams (teams that produce the actual skateboard decks).
For each table, the information of each member is included. A row with information is present for all members of the skateboard team.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used SQL in the command line, SQLite3 with python, and I even downloaded an open-source project named 'DB Browser for SQLite'

I used python for this project. I needed the sqilte3 import, the datetime import, and the time import


# Useful Websites

* [The Boardr](https://theboardr.com/)
* [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)

# Future Work

* Create a Website to more fully present a GUI
* Confirm info with skateboarding veterans
* Add more types of skate teams (not just teams that produce skate decks)
